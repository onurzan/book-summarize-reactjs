<h1>Book Summarize Web App</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Used Tech</h2>
<hr>
<p>React.js and Local Server (ChatGPT for book summarize)</p>
<hr>
<p>The main purpose of the project is to include the JSON server prepared in local storage into the project. Speeding up SPA usage and user access. For this, it is possible to reach multiple pages in a state and the server must meet the customer's request quickly.</p>
<p>PS: Book pictures are fake. I used the LoremPicsum web site.</p>
